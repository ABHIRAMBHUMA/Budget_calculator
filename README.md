1.The calculate_budget() function takes two parameters: income and expenses. It calculates the total expenses and subtracts them from the income to find the remaining budget.

2.The main() function is where the program starts its execution. It prompts the user to input their income and the number of expenses they have. Then, it prompts the user to input each expense amount one by one and stores them in a list.

3.After gathering the necessary information, it calls the calculate_budget() function to calculate the remaining budget.

4.Finally, it prints out a summary including total income, total expenses, and the remaining budget.

5.The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main() function is executed only if the script is run directly, not if it is imported as a module into another script. This is a common Python idiom for writing reusable code.
